                Stanford researchers find a quicker,<br>
                cheaper way so sort isotopes

                 Zare Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer <br>
                 grass that tickles your feet or the red Brodeaus smacking on <br>
                 your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries <br>
                 special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can <br>
                 tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance <br>
                 are from, where they traveled and what happened to them <br>
                 along the way. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new <br>
                 method to make isotopics analysis easier and less expensive.

                Chance to dance: Enthusiats fly to <br>
                Stanford for dance weekend

                Stanford is an epicenter  for the vintage dance movement--but <br>
                life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. <br>
                The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Roble Gym <br>
                offers something for modern dance enthusiats, too: the <br>
                hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood <br>
                and blues fusion.
